      <section>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Robert Bishop and I'm currently a student in a Web Coding Bootcamp being   run by the University of Washington.  I've had an interest in computers going back to when I started tinkering with my personal computer in high school.  After high school I pursued an Associates program in computer networking through a tech college in Arizona before returning to my home in the PNW.</p>
        
        <p>After college I held on to the interest but didn't really pursue IT work in a professional capacity.  For the past 10 years I've been working for a family owned copy machine business handling both hardware and connectivity job tickets.  A few months back I started talking to a family member about this Coding Bootcamp, the more I read up on it the more I felt like it would be the perfect fit for me.  I used to enjoy picking through custom codes for Myspace pages and this would give me a chance to learn how to actually create whole pages from scratch.  I really enjoy working through the process of trying to take an idea that's in my mind and spending time creating it in code.</p>

        <p>When I'm not in class or at work I spend most of my time with my wife and son.  I also enjoy gaming on my xbox, tinkering with the project car in the garage and occasionally attending concerts with my wife.</p>

        <p>I'm looking forward to continuing to build this page as I learn more styles of coding and adding on more sample works as I create them.</p>
